Hello! i'm Akira but i prefer to be called kira/dobie unless you're a close friend ofc!
You can aproach me and talk or sit in silence with me don't gotta be nervous or anything i don't bite ^^ (unless you want me to ðŸ˜ˆ./hj???)
around the age 11-17 can be friends with me, you can be 18-19 still and speak with me but we won't exactly be friends and PLEASE if you are 18+.. refrain from adding me, flirting with me, being a creep towards me, and insulting/harrassing me, even if it's as a joke (Though, i may have exceptions with a few.. not many).
If you find me weird or unfunny then ehh.. idk.. 

Stuff i like/doing: I draw, write, bake (try to), read, i LOVE reading, i love going on little walks and running, sports stuff, I LOVE french toast and bread!!! like srsly i LOVE bread.
